          <h1>Život v zahraničí – návod pre slováka</h1>
          <h2>Uvod</h2>
          <p>The world beyond our borders is home to about three million Canadians. Like you, they each have their own reasons for choosing to live in a foreign land, whether to work, study, volunteer, retire or pursue other opportunities. Residing abroad – either permanently or temporarily – can be a rich and rewarding experience.</p>
          <p>It can also be challenging, particularly if you move to another country based on a dream, without considering the risks and responsibilities. The decision to leave familiar surroundings and adapt to another social and cultural environment should not be taken lightly. It requires thorough research, knowledge and planning. The better prepared you are before leaving Canada, the better your experience abroad will be.</p>
          <p>The Government of Canada assists thousands of Canadians residing in foreign countries each year. With more than 260 offices in 150 countries worldwide – plus an Emergency Watch and Response Centre in Ottawa – we’re at your service 24 hours a day, seven days a week. While there are limits to the help we can give you, we offer a vast range of consular services, from replacing lost passports and sharing information on local laws to lending support during natural disasters and medical emergencies.</p>
          <p>We’re well aware of the challenges you’ll face while living abroad. That’s why we’ve developed this booklet to help you:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>inform and prepare yourself before leaving Canada;</li>
            <li>take care of yourself and your loved ones while abroad;</li>
            <li>know what to do if things don’t work out as expected; and</li>
            <li>plan for your eventual return.</li>
          </ul>
